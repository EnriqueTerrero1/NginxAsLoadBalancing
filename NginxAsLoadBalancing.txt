***************requirement*******************
we need 3 server
1 load balancing with nginx installed
2  web servers

in this case the 3 server are going to use nginx one as a loadbalancing and the others as a web server 

all these server SHOULD be at the same red area 

#step one , install nginx on the 3 server with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install nginx

#step two, check if the service the status 

    systemctl status nginx

if the server is active great!! if not run the following command:

    sudo systemctl start nginx

#step treet , now at the loadbalancing server, go to next directory:

   cd /etc/nginx/conf.d

#step four edit the default.conf file with the editor of your preference and write down the following command (in my case  I use nano editor):

  
upstream backend  {
  server  10.0.10.3;
  server  10.0.10.4;
 
}

 server {
  location / {
    proxy_pass  http://backend;
  }
}

#step five do a force-reload to the nginx  load balancing server :

  sudo service nginx force-reload

# step six check the status of the server using :

    systemctl status nginx

#step seven check if the load balancing is working:
	curl localhost

the website should change between servers
